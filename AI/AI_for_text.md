## Why learning AI/ML for text ?

- With AI for NLP, natural language procressing you can build applications that can make sense of natural language, which we use for most of our communications.
- Some cool projects you can build using NLP are,

1. AI assistants like Siri and Google Assistant
2. Applications that classify news as fake or not
3. AI to write poems, stories and finish your assignments

## 🎓 Take Away Skills

After completing this learning path you will be able to:

- Build AI projects solving NLP problems


## 🛠️ Prerequisites

### 🧑🏻‍💻 Programming Knowledge 
Programming knowledge in python is a must. There is no point in continuing without programming knowledge. 

You can use [Python learning path](https://github.com/GopikrishnanSasikumar/maker-station/blob/main/Web%20Dev/Backend/Languages/Python.md) to learn python :snake:

### 🤖 Basics of Machine learning

Use the [machine learning learning learning path](https://github.com/GopikrishnanSasikumar/maker-station/blob/ai-learning-path/AI/Machine%20Learning.md) and get yourself ready with basics of machine learning 

### 📲 Installation and Setup

- A laptop windows/mac is a must. 
- Would prefer a **laptop** with NVIDIA GPU or an M1 Mac
- A light weight **code editor** like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Should install python. Rest of the packages you can install on the go.
