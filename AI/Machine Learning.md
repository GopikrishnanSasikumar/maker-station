## Why learn Machine Learning ‚ùì

- With machine learning, you can build applications that can learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed, enabling them to make predictions, identify patterns, and automate tasks. 
- Some cool examples of machine learning applications include, 

1. Speech recognition used in virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa 
2. Movies and series recommender systems used by streaming platforms like Netflix
3. Object detection used in self driving cars 

## üéì Take Away Skills

After completing this learning path you will be able to:

- Build machine learning projects


## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

### üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Programming Knowledge 
Programming knowledge in python is a must. There is no point in continuing without programming knowledge. 

You can use [Python learning path](https://github.com/GopikrishnanSasikumar/maker-station/blob/main/Web%20Dev/Backend/Languages/Python.md) to learn python :snake:

```
üí° Machine learning involves mathematics. 
An interest in mathematics and knowledge in +2 level mathematics would be good.
```


### üì≤ Installation and Setup

- A laptop windows/mac is a must. 
- Would prefer a **laptop** with NVIDIA GPU or an M1 Mac
- A light weight **code editor** like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Should install python. Rest of the packages you can install on the go.
