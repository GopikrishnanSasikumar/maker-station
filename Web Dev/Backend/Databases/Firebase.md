## 📲 Installation and Setup

- You need a browser to follow along this learning path. You can choose browser of your choice. The preferred ones are listed below:
   -  **Google Chrome**
      A browser by Google based on the open source Chromium web browser project with developer tools.
      [Install Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

- **Create a Firebase account**: Go to the Firebase website and create an account. If you already have a Google account, you can use that to sign in.  

- **Create a new Firebase project**: Once you've signed in, create a new Firebase project by clicking on the "Create Project" button. Follow the prompts to set up your project.

- **Add Firebase to your app**: Depending on the platform you're developing for (web, Android, iOS), you'll need to add the Firebase SDK to your app. You can follow the instructions provided by Firebase to add the SDK to your app.
[iOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup), [Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup), [Web](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup/) and [Flutter](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android)

- **Set up Firebase services**: Firebase offers a range of services such as authentication, database, storage, and more. To use these services, you'll need to set them up in your Firebase project. Follow the prompts in the Firebase console to set up the services you need.

- **Test your app**: Once you've set up Firebase and added the SDK to your app, you can test your app to make sure everything is working as expected. Firebase provides tools and documentation to help you test your app and troubleshoot any issues.
- Alternatively, you can use the **Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI)** Tools that can be used to test, manage and deploy your Firebase project from the command line. Deploy code and assets to your Firebase projects. Run a local web server for your Firebase Hosting site. Interact with data in your Firebase database. 
[Firebase CLI reference](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
  - **Node.js**
  Required to add cloud functions via Firebase CLI
  [Install Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
