**🛠️ Get into action**

A small and easy project to test what you have learned so far:

**Random Name Generator:**  
Create web server that displays a random name from a file named [first-names.txt](https://github.com/dominictarr/random-name/blob/master/first-names.txt), which has each name on a separate line
